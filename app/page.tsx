          I am an engineering manager at Bamboo Rose. My inadvertent specialty
          is rearchitecting legacy codebases into modern, maintainable, and
          scalable web and cross-platform applications.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Along the way I strive to make the web a more accessible and inclusive
          place for everyone. I have a lot of thoughts about what it means to be
          a leader, how to manage an effective team, and how to build a healthy
          engineering culture to produce reliable, high-quality software that
          users will love.

          right this time, I will be next time.
